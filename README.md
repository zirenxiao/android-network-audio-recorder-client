# Android Network Audio Recorder Client
This project provides a simple demo to record audio from an Android device and then send all audio data to a specific server. 
## Usage
- text area: server ip
- start recording: establishs a TCP connection to the server and sends all audio data to the server.
- echo testing: (headset required!) tests your own voice. your audio data WILL also send to the server but WILL NOT save to a file in the server side.
- stop and exit: closes everything
## Add-on
- if you are connecting to an echo server, you can hear you own voice!
